        "RGBA stands for Red Green Blue Alpha. It is a color model that represents colors using a combination of red, green, blue, and alpha (transparency) components.Each component is represented by an 8-bit value, ranging from 0 to 255. The alpha component determines the transparency or opacity of a color, where 0 represents fully transparent and 255 represents fully opaque.\n",
