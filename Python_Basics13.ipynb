        "Excel spreadsheets can contain multiple sheets within a single file, allowing for better organization and management of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Excel supports a wide range of formatting options, including cell colors, font styles, conditional formatting, and formulas, providing more flexibility in data presentation and analysis.\n",

        "Excel supports the use of charts, graphs, and other visualizations, making it easier to interpret and communicate data.\n",

        "Excel can handle complex calculations and data manipulations using built-in functions and formulas.\n",
